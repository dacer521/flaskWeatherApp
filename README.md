**Weather App**

This is a weather app created for an assessment to showcase and practice skills in web development, Python, and Flask.

**Project Overview**

The app allows users to search for the weather in a given location by entering a zip code, country, city, county, or geographical area (e.g., New England or Europe).

**How to Run**

Clone or download the repository.

Run server.py.

Open a web browser and navigate to localhost:8000. The app is set to run on a local server.

**Functionality**

The app uses an API call based on the userâ€™s input with error handling.

If no value is entered, it defaults to displaying the weather for Boston.

If the entered city is not found, the user is redirected to a "City Not Found" page, prompting them to re-enter a location.

For valid inputs, the app displays:

Weather status

Temperature

Feels-like temperature

A relevant status image

A "More Info" button reveals additional details, including:

Sunrise and sunset times

Longitude and latitude

Humidity

Sea level

I attempted to create a 5 day forecat, however, the API I am using only provides the 1 day forecast in the free version, so I was inhibited from adding it.

**Requirements**

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed to run the app. Refer to the requirements.txt file for details.
